Today we opened our bamboo coin bank and it contains a total of ₱ 867.00
worth of coins.

We bought this bamboo coin bank in Lucban, Quezon on the 29<sup>th</sup> of
November 2015, when we attended Celine's Christening. We intended to drop only
ten-peso coins to it but that didn't pan out because we usually end up with
one-peso coins in our pocket.
