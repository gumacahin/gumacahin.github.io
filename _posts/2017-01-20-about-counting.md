Philippines. When it comes to counting we use the English language. It's so tiring to count in our language.

We use the English because it's faster and less tiring to say. Although we
pronounce it differently. Example, 33 is "tar·ty tree" and we say the last "t"
in twenty. Is very common for us to count in Spanish to. Compare i-sa, da-la-wa,
tat-lo to u-no, dos, tres. So when asking for a three count and you are in danger,
ask them not to count in Filipino.
