When I was in primary school, I don't do very well. Sure I was part of section
"A" but I'm not very remarkable. I suck at Math and Social Studies. I very
often miss school for no particular reason. But even with such poor performance
and attendance the school found me fit to stay in the top section.

When I was young I used to walk all the way back home. I'm on a very tight
allowance that's why sometimes I'm forced to spend money meant to pay the fare. In
one of those walk I was with a friend and along the way we stumbled upon a bunch
of kataka-taka (*[Bryophyllum pinnatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryophyllum_pinnatum)*)
plants.

My friend told me about it's magical properties. He said if I place
it between the leaves of the book of a subject I'm doing poorly at and place the
book under the pillow I sleep on at night and the leaves start to take root, I
will do better on that subject. It sounds fantastic and it sounds believable for
a young man like me. So I considered the subjects that I do poorly at---all of
them, and plucked the appropriate number of leaves from the plant. I made sure
I picked the largest and most healthy leaves believing it will have a better
effect. Right then and there I inserted the leaves between the pages of the
books I'm carrying. Once home, I inserted the rest of the leaves to the books
I left at home. You can't possibly expect me to sleep with all of those books
under my pillow, right? I believe I slept with two books under my pillow at a
time.

Within a few days the leaves started rooting. It's working! I can already feel
my brain gaining mass. Well at least that's how I felt. I never really felt the
difference at school. However, by the end of the school year I became part of
the honor roll which I never expected. It really worked! That year I proved to
my self that I can really do well in school if I chose to do so (yes, with the
help of the plant). And since then I performed at the top of my class. So if
there is any superstition I believe to be true, it's the magical properties of
the kataka-taka plant.
