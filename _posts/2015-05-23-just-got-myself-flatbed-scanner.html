I've been planning on digitizing printed materials I have on storage for years now but I've been put off for a number of reasons. Scanners used to be expensive and way outside my budget. They used to be bulky and it's going to be very inconvenient for me to buy one because back then I don't have a car and online buying options are not available. And most importantly I don't know anything about scanners to make an informed decision on which one to buy.<br /><br />I've been through a number of trimesters in <abbr title="Univesity of the Philippines Open University">UPOU</abbr>'s <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Studies">BAMS</abbr> so I learned a thing or to about digital imaging. Scanners are much better and cheaper nowadays. And I can buy stuff online and have them delivered straight to my doorstep.<br /><br />I bought my scanner off&nbsp;<a href="http://lazada.com.ph/" target="_blank">Lazada.com.ph</a>. Yes, I'm grateful enough of their service them I'm willing to give them more link juice to help their business. One of these days I'll blog about my shopping experiences with Lazada.<br /><br />It's a Canon Canoscan LiDE 220. Here are some pictures:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IH4-4TebKzE/VV-PnDsPdJI/AAAAAAAAAZo/ZWSWmDQTHoQ/s1600/IMG_3151.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IH4-4TebKzE/VV-PnDsPdJI/AAAAAAAAAZo/ZWSWmDQTHoQ/s640/IMG_3151.jpg" width="448" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">With finger oils.</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ftDc6SXx0lE/VV-Pm0iIIWI/AAAAAAAAAZs/jeV5-Igqx-o/s1600/IMG_3153.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ftDc6SXx0lE/VV-Pm0iIIWI/AAAAAAAAAZs/jeV5-Igqx-o/s640/IMG_3153.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Buttons I don't use.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iW7lH0BKa88/VV-PnM3y7vI/AAAAAAAAAZk/-l8WeZB-tGU/s1600/IMG_3152.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iW7lH0BKa88/VV-PnM3y7vI/AAAAAAAAAZk/-l8WeZB-tGU/s640/IMG_3152.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The platen.</td></tr></tbody></table>I'm very satisfied with this product. It's usb powered, light weight, and scans fast. The bundled cd is of no use for me since my Mac doesn't have a DVD drive but I got the related software from the Canon website and they just install and work.<br /><br />I pretty much spent the day scanning so much stuff. I'll probably blog about them in the coming days.<br /><br />Here is a scan of one of the printed materials I talked above earlier:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/B2klZN1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img alt="Map of UP Diliman illustrated by Juanito Torres" border="0" src="http://i.imgur.com/B2klZN1l.jpg" height="640" title="click to view in higher resolution" width="450" /></a></div><br />It's the UP Diliman map I received from UPD as a freshman over a decade ago. The map doesn't mention any copyright information. The reverse says "Produced by the UP Diliman Information Office" and the illustration is signed "Juanito Torres/June 2001."<br /><br />The map is of course larger than my scanner. It took a total of ten scans and stitched them together using photoshop.
