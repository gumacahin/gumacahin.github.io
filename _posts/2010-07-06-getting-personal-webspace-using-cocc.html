My goal here is to teach you how to get your own website that anyone can access by pointing their browser to something like http://example.co.cc. Let start by a quick definition of terms.<br /><ul><li>Domain Name - the thing you type on the browser's address bar to get you somewhere like http://example.com</li><li>Web server - the computer you reach and serves a file when you point your web browser somewhere. When you point your browser to http://example.com you reach the computer identified with the ip address 192.0.32.10 it then serves the file index.html and thus you see <a href="http://example.com/">this</a> on your browser.</li><li>Web host - a company that provides you with a web server and other stuff like database, email etc. It usually comes with a fee but the generous people at Freehostia offers their services for free.</li></ul><span style="font-size:130%;">Getting a Free Do</span><span style="font-size:130%;">main Name</span><br /><br />Use this from to get a domain name you like.<br /><iframe src="http://www.co.cc/outside_search/os.php?id=182518&amp;target=_blank&amp;bgc=ffffff&amp;inbox" noresize="" framespacing="0" frameborder="0" height="30" scrolling="no" width="250"></iframe><br /><br />You will get this page:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lAHWMFHam80/TDJcrE949sI/AAAAAAAAADw/H616eK-zkGY/s1600/Screenshot-1.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 196px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lAHWMFHam80/TDJcrE949sI/AAAAAAAAADw/H616eK-zkGY/s320/Screenshot-1.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490552790855513794" border="0" /></a><br />If the domain name you selected is available and is available for $0 go ahead and complete the registration.<br /><span style="font-size:130%;"><br />Getting a Free Web Hosting Account</span><br /><br />Sign up <a href="http://www.freehostia.com/signup.html?plan=92">here</a>. Under "Setup Your Plan" leave it to default except the sub-heading "Add Domain Name to Host." Fill it out like so instead:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lAHWMFHam80/TDJfgUZZXKI/AAAAAAAAAD4/8BzZQ00JHKw/s1600/Screenshot-2.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 90px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_lAHWMFHam80/TDJfgUZZXKI/AAAAAAAAAD4/8BzZQ00JHKw/s320/Screenshot-2.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490555904553737378" border="0" /></a><br />Fill out the rest of the form as you would any. It takes time for you to receive the confirmation email with your username and password. Just wait for it and you'll eventually receive it. Once received you may visit the control panel mentioned in the mail.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">Setting It Up</span><br /><br />Sign in to your co.cc account by visiting http://co.cc. Click "Manage Domain" on the left navigation panel. The domain name you selected should be listed on the table. Click it then click "Setup." Fill out the form like so:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lAHWMFHam80/TDJh-siu39I/AAAAAAAAAEA/V2p1LliDFyk/s1600/Screenshot-3.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 188px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lAHWMFHam80/TDJh-siu39I/AAAAAAAAAEA/V2p1LliDFyk/s320/Screenshot-3.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490558625454677970" border="0" /></a><br />Although it says it could take up to 48hrs the set-up is usually complete with in minutes. You could check by pointing your browser to your domain name. If you see a page entitled "Index of /" your website is really for your content.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">Adding Content:  A Short Filezilla Tutorial</span><br /><br />To manage the content of your website you need an ftp client. Filezilla the best one around. It's free to download <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client">here</a>. To connect to your webserver launch  Filezilla and enter the following:<br /><ul><li>Host - your domain name "example.co.cc"</li><li>Username - same as your freehostia username</li><li>Password - same as your freehostia password</li></ul>The click quick connect.<br /><br />With a text editor create a file named index.html and type in a sample content lets say: <pre>&lt;h1&gt;Hello! Welcome to my site.&lt;/h1&gt;</pre> Save the file make sure the the suffix is<span style="font-weight: bold;"> html</span> not txt. On Filezilla navigate the left pane (local site) to the directory that contains your index.html file and navigate the right pane to the folder named after your domain name. Double click index.html on the left pane to upload it. Visit your site again and you should see your content.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">Conclusion</span><br /><br />That's it! Next time I'll write about how to make a blog, a picture, gallery or a forum out of your free web space. Enjoy!
