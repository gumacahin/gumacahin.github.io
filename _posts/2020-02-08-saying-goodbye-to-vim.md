title: Saying Goodbye to Vim

I've been using Vim for web development for the last 11 years. Now that I'm 
transitioning to mobile it has gotten more difficult not to move to VS Code.
I was kinda hoping the Vim extension was gonna help me ease into it but my
muscle memory is getting messed up. I had to abandon the Vim way if I'm going to
be productive in VS Code.

I remember writing my first code in Vim. Getting started with Vim was quite a
chore:

1. `cd` to your project's directory.
2. Type press `v`, `i`  and type the filename.
3. Press `i`. 
4. Edit with the use of arrow keys.
5. To save press escape and type colon.

I'm confused to how asinine the whole process was. It wasn't until I got my
first Ubuntu machine that I finally got the answer. It was a modal editor and
a pretty good one too. I've gone on from hating to loving it. I ended up using
Vim for pretty much every code every code I've writen thus far.

Vim is awesome!
