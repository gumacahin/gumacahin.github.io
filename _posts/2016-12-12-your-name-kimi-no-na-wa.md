I really have to get this out of my systemâ€¦ If you haven't seen the film the
animated film "Kimi no Na Wa" (Your Name), do yourself a favor and watch it now.
I suggest you bring lots of tissue if you are the emotional type.

I'm not a film critic to be honest. I haven't seen that many animated Japanese
films but I've seen a couple of critictly acclaimed ones like "Ghost in the 
Shell" and "Spirited Away." However, I'll tell you now that this firm is at par
with the couple of films I mentioned.

I'd admit that I cried when I watched "Sprited Away" for the first time but
never again after that. I cried, I cried a lot, when I first seen "Your Name."
I had to wake up my wife so early in the morning to kiss, hug and tell her I
love her after my first viewing. It just brought it so much feels that I had to
do what I did. My wife viewed the film with me. That's my second time I've seen
the film and I still cried like a baby.

"Your Name" is by far the best film I've seen thus far. The music of course is
in Japanese but the lyrics are written in the subtitles. Even the lyrics is 
enough to bring me to tears at times.

I already spent quite sometime asking my frieds if the've heared or seen the film
already and asking them to see if they haven't yet. I sure am looking forward to
seeing it on a big screen!
