I finally wrote it down. I originally [posted this on reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5ooym4/are_there_any_filipino_brand_whose_serviceproduct/dcl5q6z/).

Jollibee. I believe McDonald's burgers are better but Jollibee has a very 
special place in my heart.

Back in college I had to take a very long trip from our town to Diliman. It's 
such a long commute that I only return home in the end of the semester. I 
usually leave early to arrive in Diliman when the offices have just opened so I
usually skip breakfast. On my trip back I'll be haunted by thoughts of not being
able to see my friends, getting stressed by all the school work, being alone, 
etc. By the time I arrive in Kamias I'm tired, hungry and miserable. 

Theres a [Jollibee branch in Kamias that is close to the JAC terminal](https://www.google.com.ph/maps/place/Jollibee/@14.6310371,121.0466764,19.07z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sjollibee+kamias!3m4!1s0x3397b7babefa6dff:0x1989c864f35158e9!8m2!3d14.6311273!4d121.0461637?hl=en) where I 
alight. I usually don't go to fast-food stores because it's expensive, but this 
one time I'm very hungry and depressed I don't care anymore. I entered the store
with my head down and my gaze on the floor. But the guard that opened the door 
greeted me with the usual, "Good morning po sir. Welcome po to Jollibee." took 
the time actually bend his knees a little and stoop so he can meet me
eye-to-eye. Not with the look of concern like of a security guard concerned 
about my disposition but with the look of a friend trying to cheer me up. 
This is true for all the staff that chanced upon me on my way to the counter.
By the time I'm at the counter there's a smile in my face when I greeted the
beautiful lady at the counter. I teared up as I ate my breakfast. From that 
moment on it has been a habit of mine to start the semester with breakfast from
that place. Being in that place removes all the negative vibes I was carrying 
and makes me look forward to the upcoming semester. Jollibee has a very special
place in my heart.

<ins>Edit: I want to add. I have difficulty talking to strangers. This happened
in the same Jollibee branchâ€¦ I forgot to ask for ketchup. They didn't give me 
one because the meal doesn't usually go with ketchup (I'm weird). I looked 
around intending to go to the counter to ask for ketchup after I scouted my 
surroundings. One of the crew cleaning a table met my eyes, smiled, approached 
me, and asked me if I needed anything. That joint is really one of a kind.</ins>
