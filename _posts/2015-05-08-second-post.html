You know you are struggling in the art of blogging when you can't even think of an appropriate blog title.<div><br /></div><div>I intended to use this blog for blog requirements in my BAMS courses starting with MMS 173. That didn't come to pass because we were required to blog in the UPOU's own ePortfolio website. MMS 172 allows blogging outside of ePortfolio so this part of the web will be seeing some action at least every three weeks.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway the trimester is well on it's way. Here's my first activity on MMS 176: animation in multimedia:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QT3QH7W.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://i.imgur.com/QT3QH7W.jpg" height="247" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Yes, I'm not an artist. It's a drawing skill assessment activity. Now my FIC knows that I can't draw.</div><div><br /></div><div>The second activity for 176 is creating a youtube account and uploading a video saying hello. So here's me saying hello:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-fb3e9dd3bc6d3557" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Dfb3e9dd3bc6d3557%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1485491098%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D6F07572D65C4E1B3E98373BD6F1A9A7429D2CD24.7FB436839405C2C0D22ABD148281C303364A70AC%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Dfb3e9dd3bc6d3557%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DEePyOJ-530gX1op6YcidZDRSihM&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Dfb3e9dd3bc6d3557%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1485491098%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D6F07572D65C4E1B3E98373BD6F1A9A7429D2CD24.7FB436839405C2C0D22ABD148281C303364A70AC%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Dfb3e9dd3bc6d3557%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DEePyOJ-530gX1op6YcidZDRSihM&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div><div><br /></div><div>&lt;rant&gt;Well that's dumb... My Google account is tied to two youtube channels because Google insisted on having Google+ on youtube. I had to reupload the video here since the video I uploaded in youtube is not listed when I go to the "Youtube Video" tab of the add video dialog.&lt;/rant&gt;</div><div><br /></div><div>I hope everything goes well this trimester.</div>
