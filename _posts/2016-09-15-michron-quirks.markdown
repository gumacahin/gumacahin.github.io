Michron is a neat little time lapse gadget by Alpine Labs. If find it very useful
but takes a lot of time and patience to master, especially if you plan on doing
any bulb ramping time lapse. I strongly suggest you go over all the tutorial
videos about Michron that Alpine Labs created.

I ran a few experiments to figure out some of the quirks with Michron and list
the results below.

* The loaded time lapse is restarted everytime michron is turned on. This is true
even when the time lapse finished or is asked by the app to stop.

* As pointed out in the Alpine Labs tutorial, when bulb and hold settings, the
exposure time recorded by you camera will be different from the hold/bulb
duration you set in Michron. You’d need to run experiments to figure out the
fastest possible shutter speed that will give you a consistent exposure.

* When bulb ramping, the first image, is more often than not inconsistent and
must be discarded.

* Once started a bulb ramp continues for the rest of the time lapse. For
example, if you have a one hour time lapse and you set up Michron to start a
bulb ramp ten minutes into the time lapse for a thirty minute duration, the
shutter speed for the last twenty minutes of the time lapse will still be bulb
ramped.

* Bulb ramp ignores delay settings. We need a work around for this. For example,
if we want a 1 hour bulb ramping but we want a 30 min delay we have to set
the time lapse duration for one hour and thirty minutes. Then, set a delay of
thirty mins. Then, set the bulb ramp to delay for thirty minutes. If we didn’t
have a thirty minute delay in the bulb ramp setting, the bulb ramp will start
kicking in immediately regardless of the delay settings.
