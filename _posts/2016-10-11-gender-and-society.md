Facebook has been kind enough to remind me that today, Oct 11<sup>th</sup> 2016
is the [International Day of the Girl Child](http://www.un.org/en/events/girlchild/
"links to the UN event page"). It's been a week since I delivered a short lecture
about gender and society to a small audience in Gumaca National High School (GNHS)
and I've been thinking of sharing my experience about that for a while now. What
better day to do that now.

I'm currently taking BA Multimedia Studies (BAMS) in [UPOU](http://www2.upou.edu.ph
"links to the UPOU website"). My first brush to the deeper insights regarding
gender and society is with MMS 111: Gender and Multimedia. Through that course
I learned about gender, society and some feminist theories. I barely scratched
the surface and I wanted to learn more. BAMS have a list of electives that we
can chose to take. I initially wanted to take Psych 101 but my adviser told
me that the course is no longer being offered. I asked if it's possible to take
Soc Sci 13 instead, it's not among the list of electives I can take, and he
agreed. 

The first four modules of Soc Sci 13 has been a real eye opener for me. For our
first assignment we are to teach to a small audience what we've learned from the
course thus far. The requirements states that my audience should be composed of
at least seven individuals. I initially thought of having adult relatives for my
assignment but thought better of it. I asked a friend who teaches in GNHS and
also happens to be an adviser of the school's student newspaper, "Ang Muog", 
if he would allow me to deliver a short lecture on gender and society. He agreed
and even offered the use of their IT room and projector. "This is gonna be 
awesome.", I said to myself.

We initially agreed to hold the lecture on the coming week which will coincide
with activities for World Teacher's day. The following Monday I dropped by the 
Muog office to test if my Mac Book Pro would work on their projector. The MBP
only has HDMI output while the projector only has VGI input. We tested with an
adapter and it didn't work! Good thing we tested otherwise it would be rather
awkward during the lecture. He then said we will have the lecture tomorrow,
Tuesday. I agreed, since I really what to get it over with. It's the 4<sup>th</sup>
of October and the deadline is on the 9<sup>th</sup>. But then I realized I'm
yet to finish reading the last module on gender discrimination, I have to borrow
another laptop, I have to create my presentation and I have to think of a way
to provide snacks and refreshments. "Oh crap!"

First thing I did when I got home is to ask my wife the help me borrow a laptop
from a friend or relative. Then I went to McDonald's to order food---burger and
drinks for twenty-five individuals. Once back home I set about reading the rest
of the modules and reviewing the earlier ones for my presentation.

The next day, the day of my presentation. I set about creating my slide show. I
found out that the laptop we got is about five years old and quite difficult to
work with and to my horror it doesn't have MS Power Point. An alternative would
be prezi but even this option would be problematic. First, I've never used it
before. Second, it requires a stable internet connection. I was able to solve
the first issue by playing with it a bit. It's actually quite easy once you get
the hang of it. Next, how do I get to use this thing offline? I found out it's
possible to export the prezintation for offline use but it requires a "pro"
account. So I signed up. Good thing there's a 14-day trial. By this time it's
3:30 in the afternoon and my lecture is scheduled at 4 and the stuff I ordered
from McDonald's is supposed to be delivered by 4:15PM. So I packed up, took a
shower, double checked my stuff and went on my way to GNHS.

By the time I got there it's a few minutes past 4PM. I immediately started
setting up my equipment. When I tried to set up the laptop with the projector it
was not working initially and none of guys around are sure of what to do. With a
bit perseverance and a lot of luck I finally got it to work. "Whew!"

We invited the students in and I started my lecture. Everything was captured in
the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DUTstO3jrU) I recorded as part of
the assignment so I won't get into details with that. I would only say it was an
awesome experience for me. I realized that I really do like teaching. Maybe it's
not too late for me a teacher. I love the look on the students faces when they
learn something they never heard before. Or even the collective gasps I hear 
when they learn something unexpected. Overall I would definitely would do this
again given the chance.

I was a bit nervous near the and of the lecture. Not only do I realise that I'm
way past the time limit requirement for the assignment but also because I'm
afraid of making a mistake and embarrassing myself. I totally forgot to ask for
questions. I did, however, asked for questions after I turned of the camera.

The applause I received from the students made me even more nervous. I'm not used
to it. I did made the whole thing totally worth it. It's totally awesome. With
that. I said thanks, packed up my stuff and invited them the have some snacks
and refreshments.

My thanks to the staffers and advisers of "Ang Muog" specially to Mr. Arjay
Oribiana for making this possible. Below are pictures of me and the students in
my audience which grabbed from Arjay's facebook page.
