Today I was on a van with none other than Angel Locsin. Instead of asking her if I can take a picture with her I asked her for the names of a number of “kapamilya” stars. She couldn’t name any. My questions were interrupted when a couple of elderly women approached the van and talked to our driver. I told the driver that those persons are “budol-budol” and we promptly left. As our vehicle drives off I saw the police beating the shit out of the women. When I turned my head to talk to Angel she is already on the other side of the van.
