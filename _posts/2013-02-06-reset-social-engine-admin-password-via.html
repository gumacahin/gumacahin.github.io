You may execute the following MySQL statements in order to reset the admin password. By admin password I mean the first user created when you installed SE4.<br /><br /><pre><br />select @salt := salt from engine4_users where user_id = 1;<br />update engine4_users set password = md5(<br /> concat(<br />  (select value from engine4_core_settings where name = 'core.secret'),<br />  'temppassword',<br />  @salt))<br /> where user_id = 1;<br /><br /></pre> After running this script the password of the user with user_id = 1 (the first admin user) will now be 'temppassword'.<br /><br />Of course by simply changing the user_id you can use the same snippet to reset the password of any other user.<br /><br />Be sure to login and change the temporary password immediately.
