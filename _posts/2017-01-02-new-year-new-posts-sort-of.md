**Happy New Year!**

It's been a while since my last post. It think it has become a tradition that
I start a new blog everytime a new year starts. This time I decided to keep this
one and just import all the contents from the previous blogs that I have
abandonned. I used jekyll's import feature but it's a bit quirky I fix them 
when I have the time.
