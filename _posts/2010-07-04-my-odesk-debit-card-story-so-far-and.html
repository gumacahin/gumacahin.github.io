I decided to give the oDesk debit card a try. Its $2/withdrawal compared to $1/withdrawal with Paypal. The card is offered for free so I decided to sign up.<br /><br />The application easy enough. In the end it's asking me for a scan of "valid id." The only choices available in my case is a driver's license and a social security id neither of which I have. "I won't be getting this one", I thought. A couple of weeks later I got an email from Payoneer (the company that handles these cards) telling me that I got approved for the account and that my card is on the way. Ecstatic I am...<br /><br />My card came I activated it and decided to give it a try. I'm expecting fees but I should have expected a lot of fees:<br /><ul><li>Getting my funds out of oDesk and to my Payoneer account: $2</li><li>Topping up the debit card with funds from Payoneer: $2</li><li>Withdrawing from ATM: $2.15</li><li>Card maintenance (assessed per transaction): $3.00</li></ul>Since I worked on for a card company before I'm pretty sure US card holders can bare these fees (I process payments over the phone for $20 for that card company). I'm not from the US and I certainly can't bear these fees.<br /><br />So I guess a little later this card has an appointment with my scissors.
