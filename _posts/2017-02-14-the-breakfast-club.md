title: The Breakfast Club
---
A few weeks ago, I guess, I invited my wife to watch "The Breakfast Club" with me.
I don't know how many times I've seen it but I'm sure it's more than a couple of
times. I always catch it playing on HBO when I was younger though I never thought
of downloading it or watching it online until I've seen it on Netflix.

I believe I was a teenager or at least my early twenties when I first seen it.
I like the movie when I was young. I can totally relate to the issues the
characters in the movie is going though. I especially have a connection with the
smart guy who got in detention because of the gun (a flare) in his locker.
Bottom line is I believe it's a good movie when I was young. I thought I cried
back then.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I was watching it with my wife---now at my
early 30's and I find it terrible. My wife told me she's disappointed she was
all hyped up because of my enthusiasm but it was a major let down. I felt the
same. It felt like the issue of each kid in the movie is so superficial but they
make a big deal out of it. You know, like a teenager. O, the difference in opinion
a decade makes.
