Filipino meals consists of *kanin* (steamed rice) and *ulam*. *Ulam* is often
translated to English as “viand” but it's not a very accurate translation and
I don’t think there ever is an accurate English translation since the *ulam* 
only (as far as I know) only exists in rice eating cultures.

There's a particular *ulam* I truly hate. It's the
*[ginanga](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/ginanga/)*. It's fish cooked in
lots of vinegar.

I grew up in a poor household. My mother works abroad and we a left to the care
of my grandmother. I love her cooking and when I was little, I remember having
*ginanga* very often. The *ginanga* is cheap, easy to cook and doesn't spoil
easy because of the vinegar. Because of this, when *ginanga* is prepared you can
expect to eat it multiple meals in a row. When you eat something far too often
you'll learn to hate it. That's why I hate *ginanga*.

I know my childhood is not as tragic as it seems but personally I find it sad.
The *ginanga* reminds me of my childhood that's why I avoid it like the plauge.
When my wife woke me up to and told me that we are having *ginanga* my heart
sank. Below is a picture of the *ginanga* she cooked. I just told her never to
make *ginanga* ever again. It's probably the picture of the last *ginanga*
she'll ever prepare for our family.
