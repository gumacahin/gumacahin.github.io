I can't understand why Filipino has mixed standards when it comes to
measurements. Whenever you go to any store and you tell them how much of the
item you are purchasing you'll always have to confirm the unit of measure. For
example, when you ask for the price of a length of wire it's probably by the
meter. A length of cloth? That's by the yard. How about volume? Water from the
tap is in cubic meter. Water from water stations is by the gallon. We are used
to giving our height and weight in feet and pounds respectively. Since that's
how they are measured in school and what's generally used in the entertainment
sector (i.e. basketball). However, when you fill out any government documents the
fields are in metric. And so when it comes to paper sizes it's the same
kerfuffle.

My troubles started when I purchased a printer early this year thinking my kids
will probably require a lot of printed material in their school work. I need to
purchase paper of course. In the Philippines, the paper you feed to desktop
printers are called my names: "typewriting paper", or simply "typewriting" and
"coupon bond paper", often misheard as "cocon bond" so simply "bond paper." They
come it two sizes: "long" and "short." This is where the trouble starts.

I'm quite familiar with the short bond paper. I've used it many times during my
school days. I'm fairly certain that it measures 8.5 by 11 inches. This paper
size is known as the US Letter.

To test my printer if purchased some sheets of bond paper from a local stationary
shop. I asked for short bond paper and they pointed me to a stack of them.
Normally, I assumed that these are 8.5 × 11 inches. I ended up printing math
exercises on them for my kids. When I ran out of sheets I purchased a reem of
short bond paper from bookstore.

As shown above the measurements are in millimeters. I being lazy just assumed
that it is 8.5 × 11. Then I printed math exercises on them and tried to stack
them with the previous ones I printed, to my surprise, they don't stack up. The
ream of paper I purchased is not US letter but A4 size which is 8.27 × 11.69
inches! To which it thought, "I just have to keep that in mind it will never
happen again." Or so I thought…

A few months into the school year my wife asked be to print some materials for
my kid's school work. She told me it is to be printed in long bond paper sheets.
I asked her to buy a few sheets from our local stationary store. I'm not very
familiar with the long bond paper. It's very rarely required during my school
days. Not wanting to repeat my previous mistake with the short bond paper, I
did my research on paper sizes. A4 and US letter are different. Although I can
refer to both of them as "short". So I assumed the same with the long bond
paper. A4 is an ISO standard "short" bond paper so there must be a long bond
paper in the ISO standard. But upon checking on the illustration below. It is
clear that there is no such thing.

I found it safe to assume that the long bond paper is the US Legal size which
measures 8.5 × 14 inches. So I fed the paper into my printer, selected US Legal
from the print dialog and hit print. To my dismay, the bottom part of the page
I'm printing was truncated. I measured the paper and it measures 8.5 × 13!

So back to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size "links to wikipedia's article on paper sizes")
I go. I found out that US paper sizes are standard in the US, Philippines and 
Chile. However, Chile and the Philippines' legal size is 8.5 × 13!
