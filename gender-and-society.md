## About

This page contains links to references, image sources and other materials
related to my assignment in SOC SCI 13.

The requirement of the assigment is stated as thus:

> You are to take part in creating awareness and spreading accurate information
> about topics and issues related to Gender and Society.  Recruit at least seven
> audience members to whom you will discuss what you have learned from Modules
> 1-4.  The discussion shall be an organized educational session for the 
> learners, lasting 15-18 minutes, video-recorded and documented in a write-up 
> for submission.

I delivered a short lecture to the staffers and advisers of “Ang Muog”, the
student newspaper in Filipino of Gumaca National High School on the
4<sup>th<sup> of October 2016. 

## The Recording

This recording was made with a Canon EF-S 10--18mm 4.5--5.6 IS STM lens, mounted
on a Canon 70D. It was preprocessed with Adobe Premier Pro. Text credits were
added. Lighting was adjusted as well. Other than concatenating the two clips
(the recording was automatically split into two due to the 4GB limitation of
FAT32) no cuts or edits whatsoever was made on the clips.
