My SO recently got hooked to Mother Monster. My wife and I pretty much have the
same history on how were introduced to Lady Gaga. Both of us loved the singles
that she released ("Paparazzi", "Bad Romance", "Just Dance") but never explored
further. It all started when she saw Lady Gaga's half-time show on YouTube.
Since then, she can't get enough of her. She constantly listened to her music,
watched her video and read about her whenever she gets the chance. She's a
mother of two and I work from home. When I'm in front of the computer and the 
kids are in school she listens to her music to keep her company. I've seen her 
bust a move while doing chores around the house. Pretty sight to be honest. When
she's tired and needs to lie down, she watches Lady Gaga on her phone. She
totally adores Mother Monster. She constantly talks to me about her: How 
passionate she is, how talented and how hardworking and full of energy. And I 
totally agree. She believes she's very lucky to have her with us.

She never bothered sending celebrities messages because I told her that stars 
have people to manage their social media accounts. But she didn't hesitate 
sending Lady Gaga a [message](https://i.imgur.com/iED3Zme.jpg) when she found 
out she didn't feel well.

Lady Gaga is like her best friend who knows her well. I always loved how she 
wears her hair long even when others talk to her negatively about it. When she
learned about the song, she felt totally liberated and more confident. She even
had her hair done styled [this way](https://i.imgur.com/LTXRQUD.png) and 
never looked back.



This proves to be contagious and I caught it too. I often find myself playing "This is Lady Gaga" playlist on Spotify.
