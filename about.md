_I’m under construction._

Hello!  My name is Marco Enrico Alviar. I’m a web developer, father and student.
This is my little corner of the web. Here I plan on keeping a blog, portfolio
and other things. I decided to keep things simple at first and just keep adding
content. My previous attempts at blogging and maitaining a personal website all
ended up being abandonned. But not after spending hours making trying to make it
look good. In hindsight, I might have been better of spending those hours
generating content. And that is what I'm doing now.
