## SNAP Hydroponics Info

I started the website ```https://www.snapdroponics.info```
to serve as an online repository of information about SNAP Hydroponics. When I
first started using SNAP Hydroponics very little information about it is 
available online. I set about changing that by voluntarily establishing SNAP
Hydroponics's online presence through a website, social media and online
communities.

## SNAP Hydroponics Growers Group

What started as a small support group for SNAP Hydroponics has grown into a
thriving and active online community of gardening enthusiasts. 

## Bahay Kubo Project

The Bahay Kubo Project is an online collaborative learning activity by
SNAP Hydroponics Growers Facebook group. Its goal is to create a “Bahay Kubo” 
music video and learn and exchange ideas along the way.
