In this multi-part post, I will teach you how to create a social engine module. I'll try touch every bells and&nbsp;whistles of SE4 module development. Since I'm lacking &nbsp;ideas for introductory statements let's get started.<br /><br />We will be creating a car module. The module will enable users to create cars. Cars will have a profile page, can be liked, can be commented on, has a profile photo, can have albums if the album module is available and can have videos if the video module is available. The module will also provide a number of car related widgets.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Begin by installing creating a local development site of SE4 (this guide will refer to it as localhost) and adding the album and video modules. &nbsp;Now go to Admin &gt; Manage &gt; Packages &amp; Plugins &gt; Developer SDK &gt; Create a Package. Select "module" as type and set "car" as the module name. Fill out the other fields as you see fit.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Please note that even though the field description of the name field says "</span><span style="background-color: white;">Lowercase, alphanumeric, and hyphens ("-") only"</span> it is not advisable to use hyphens in the module name if the module will be using widgets. Let us take for example that we decided to use "my-car" as the module name. This means the modules resources will be prefixed with MyCar_. Models will be, MyCar_Model_, forms will be MyCar_Form, controllers wil be MyCar_...Controller etc. Also the module will reside in the path <code>application/modules/MyCar/</code>. The problem will be the with widgets. They will be under application/modules/MyCar/widgets and the classes will be prefixed with MyCar_Widget_. SE4 will not be able to load widgets that are prefixed with camel cased module names (camel casing is caused by the hyphen). You may try to load a widget using my-car.widgetname for example but this will not work since SE4 will try to look for it in application/modules/Mycar instead of application/modules/MyCar. This could be a bug. To avoid it simply avoid the use hyphens in the module's name.<br /><br />Create the module download it, and install it in the development site. Put the site in development mode. It's advisable to use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/">firefox</a> with <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">firebug</a> and <a href="http://www.firephp.org/">firephp</a> during development as a number of development logs appear in the firebug console when SE4 is in development mode.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X3RGYtjUagY/UAICPzzGqgI/AAAAAAAAALA/m3xh3B2tCHs/s1600/firebug.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="157" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X3RGYtjUagY/UAICPzzGqgI/AAAAAAAAALA/m3xh3B2tCHs/s400/firebug.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />Now point the browser to /car. If you can see the default page for the car module that means you are good to go to the<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-07-14-complete-guide-to-social-engine-4_14 %}"> next step</a>.
