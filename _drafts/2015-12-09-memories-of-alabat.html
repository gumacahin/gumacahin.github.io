<h2>Backstory</h2><div>After working abroad for over returned years, my mother came back in 1990. It wasn’t a pleasant affair because by the time her 2 week vacation was over my father left us, never to return. My mother decided to “hide” us from my father that is why we ended up in Alabat, Quezon.</div><div><br /></div><h2>Barangay Tres</h2><div>My uncle is a local in Alabat. He helped us settle down. By the time we arrived there our would be home is still being constructed so we had to rent a house. This house was located in Barangay Tres.</div>
